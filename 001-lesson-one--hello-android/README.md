Lesson One - Hello Android
==========================

In this lesson we have a high level overview on how to write Kotlin code for a Hello Android application.

Specifically we demonstrate how an Android project is created using Android Studio, structured with important configuration files like `gradle.build` and `AndroidManifest.xml` and in the end we learn how to create Kotlin functions to be invoked by Android code.

Code activity
-------------
In this code activity you are challenged to modify the demo created in this lesson and create a function with a single argument and additionally with documentation.

Step by step:
1. Open Android Studio and click in **Open an Existing Project**
2. Navigate to the folder where [hello-android-initial-code](./hello-android-initial-code) is located, select it and click **OK**
3. Wait for the **build** process to complete
4. Open the file [SecondFragment.kt](./hello-android-initial-code/app/src/main/java/com/android/example/hello/SecondFragment.kt)
5. There's **2 TODO's** for you to complete as the challenge
6. When you finish to implement **both TODO's**, on Android Studio click Run 'app' <img src="../images/studio/buttons/toolbar-run.png" style="height: 1.2em;vertical-align: sub;">.
